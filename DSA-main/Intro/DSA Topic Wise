Kahns Algorithm:
    Keep track of incoming edges into each node(in-degree). Works by repeatedly visiting nodes by in-degrees is 0.
    Example 1->2, 2->3, 1->3
    In-degrees:
        1 has 0
        2 has 1
        3 has 2 Remove 1 decrease degree of 2 by 1 and then of 3.

Page Rank Algorithm:
    Output a probability distribution used to represent likelihood person randomly clicked on link will arrive particular page.

Dijkstras Algorithm:
    

0-1 Breadth First Search:
