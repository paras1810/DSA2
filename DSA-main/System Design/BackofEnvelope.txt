Important Numbers:
    Power of 2 latency Numbers and availability numbers.
    Power of 2:
        Byte sequence of 8 bits. ASCII use one byte of memory.
        Power 10, 20, 30, 40, 50-->KB, MB, GB, TB, PB.
    Latency numbers:
        L1 cache .5ns
        Branch Mispredict 5ns 
        L2 Cache 7ns
        Mutex Lock/Unlock 100ns
        Main memory 100ns 
        Compress 1k byte with zippy 10us 
        Send 2k over GBPS n/w 20us
        Read 1 MB sequentially 250us
        Round trip with same data centre 500us
        Disk seek 10ms
        Read 1MB sequentially from n/w or disk 10ms or 30ms
        Send packet CA->Netherlands 150ms 
        Points:
            Memory is fast but disk is slow.
            Avoid disk seeks
            Single compression algo faster. Compress data before sending over internet.
            Data centre are in diff region so take time.
    Availability Numbers:
        Service fall b/w 99% to 100%.
        Cloud provider like Amazon, Google, Microsoft keep SLAs above 99.9%.
        99%->3.65day/year, 99.9%-->8.77hour/year, 99.99% 52.60min/year, 99.999%-->5.26min/year, 99.9999-->31.56sec/year 
Twitter QPS:
    300 million monthly active users.
    50% of user twit daily
    User post two tweet per day.
    10% contain media.
    Data stored for 5 years.
    Solution:
        Query per second: 
            Daily Active User=300million*50%=150million
            Tweet QPS=150million*2tweet/24/3600=3500
            Peek QPS=3500*2=7000
        Estimate Media:
            Average Tweet size=tweet_id+text+media=64bytes+140bytes+1MB
            Media=150million*2*10%*1MB=30TB per day 
            5year = 5*365*30TB=55PB
Tips:
    Rounding Numbers
    Write down assumption
    Label your unit
    QPS, Peak QPS, storage, cache, number of servers
