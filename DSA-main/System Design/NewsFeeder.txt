Establish Design scope:(3-10 min)
    Question to ask?
        What specific feature going to built
        How many user product have
        How company scale up? Sale in 3, 6 and 12 months
        What company tech stack? What existing service you leverage to simplify design 
High Level Design and Buy in:(10-15 min)
    Initial Blue Print of Design
    Box Diagram such as client(mobile/web), APIs, web servers, data stores, cache, CDN, message queue.
    Back of envelope calculation evaluate if blueprint fits constraints
    Need to include database schema and API endpoints.
Design Deep Dive:(10-25 min)
    Like for URL shortener dive into hash function that convert long url into short one.
    For a chat system how to reduce latency and support online/offline status.
    Edge Rank algorithm of Facebook feed ranking not ideal as it take your precious time.
Wrap Up:(3-5 min)
    Error Cases(Server Failure, Network Loss)
    Operation Issues. Monitor metrics and error logs.
    From 1 million to 10 million users.

New Feed Design:
    Design Scope:
        Mobile App or Web App 
        To make post and see friend's news feed.
        Feed sorted by reverse chronological order.
        DAU(Daily Active User): 10 million user per 5000 friend
        Contain media file both image and videos.
    High Level Design:
        Feed Publishing: Publish a post written into cache and DB. Post populated into friend new feed.
            v1/me/feed?content=Hello&auth_token={auth_token}
        News Feed Building: Built by aggregating friend post in reverse chronological order.
            v1/me/feed
