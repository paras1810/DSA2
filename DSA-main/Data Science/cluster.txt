Cluster Ananlysis:
    A multivariate statistical technique groups observation on basis some of variabes and features described by.
    Goal is maximize similarity between cluster and maximize dissimilarity between cluster.

Several Clustering Problems
    Market Segmentation
        Scatter plot
        Customer on basis of spenditure and age
        Countries on basis of location and language
    Image Segmentation
Classifiaction vs Clustering
    Supervised Learning(labelled data)
        Regression: Linear
        Classification: Logistic
            Naive Bayes 
    Unsupervised Learning:
        Clustering: K-Means
            Distance b/w two points and centroid
            Eucledian distance: ((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y2)^2+(z2-z1)^2....n)^(1/2)
            Centroid or Centre of Mass
K-Means
    Chose number of cluster
    Specify cluster seeds (Basically started centroid)
    Assign each point to centroid.
    Adjust centroids.
    Cons:
        Finding K Soln: Elbow method
        Sensitive to initialization k-means++
        Sensitive to outliers  Remove outliers
        Produce spherical solutions
    Useful:
        Exploratory
            Get acquinated with data
            Search for patterns
            Plan
        Confirmatory
            Explain phenomenon
            Confirm hypothesis
            Validate previous research
        Explanatory
    Standardization

Types of Clustering:(psycology, intelligence, others)
    Flat 
        K-Means 
    Hierarchical
        Agglomerative(Bottom-Up)
            Dendogram
                Where to draw line? Number of connection broke are equals to number of cluster formed.
                Ward method 
        Divisive (Top-Down)
Heatmap
    -1.6 to 1.6
    From white to black
