    Naive Bayes:
        Specifically used for text based. i.e. Mail is spam or not(ham problem) 
        Algorithm assumes feature are independent.
        Multinomial Naive Bayes 
            Frequency of word is used as feature.
        Bernoulli Naive Bayes 
            Used for binary/boolean features.
        P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)
        P(spam)=30%
        P(win|spam)=50%
    Tokenization and Vectorization:
        Converting sequence of text into smaller parts known as tokens.
        Getting vectors out of these words as bag of words.
            vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
    Imbalanced Data Sets:
        Data set with skewed class proportions.
        Resampling: Modify original dataset create new dataset with more balance class distribution.
            Oversampling increase minority class.
        SMOTE generates new synthetic samples in minority class from slight changes in data points.
        Weighted Classes: assign different class weight.
        Data Augmentation: technique generate new data from existing.
    Optimizing Data:
        Handling missing values 
        Correlation Analysis
        Text analysis of reviews
    Steps:
        Preprocessing
