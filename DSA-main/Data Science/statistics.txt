Population
    Collection of all item of interest N    
Sample
    Subset of population n.
    Randomness and Representativeness.

Descriptive Statistics:
    Types of Data:  
        Categorical: Mercedes, BMW, Audi
            Frequency Distribution table, Bar chart, Pie Chart, Pareto Diagram
            Gender
        Numerical:
            Frequency Distribution table, Histogram, SidebySide Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, 
            Discrete
            Continuous
    Measurement Level:
        Quantitative
            Interval
            Ratio
        Qualitative
            Nominal
            Ordinal
Inferential Statistics:
    Distribution:
        Normal: Also known as Gaussian  Zstats
            Has bell curved, Mean=Median=Mode
            N~(xmean,sigma^2)
            Standardization: Changing mean to 0 and SD to 1.
                Z=x-xmean/sigm/n^(1/2)
                sigma: Population SD
            Central Limit Theorm:
                No matter underlying Distribution sampling Distribution approx normal.
            Standard Error:Show how well approx true mean. sigm/n^(1/2)
        Binomial
        Uniform:
            Discrete Uniform: All have equal chance to occur
                Rolling one or two Die.
        Student-T Distribution: For more than 30 sample use Z table
            Inference through small sample.
            Unknown population variance
            Huge real life application
            T=x-xmean/SD/n^(1/2)
            SD sample SD
        Confidential Intervals: commonly 95%
            alpa b/w zero and one
            point estimate-reliability factor*Standard error
            Zstatistics
            mean-zalpha/2*std error(sigma/n^(1/2)), mean+zalpha/2*std error(sigma/n^(1/2))
            for 95% confidence alpha is 5%
        Margin of error:
            Range of confidence interval of S and T Distribution
    Hypothesis Testing:
        Formulate Hypothesis
        Find right test 
        Execute test 
        Make Decision
        Null: H0
            We assume its true and try to prove otherwise.
            Status Quo
        Alternate: H1 or HA
            Change or Innovation
        Significance Level:
            Cold Drink in bottle more significant than cold drink one drinks.
            Scale it to Z.
            Check if Z in rejection region.
        Type I vs Type II Error.
            Type 1:
                Reject true null hypothesis.
                False positive
            Type II:
                False Negative 
            p=1-alpha Power of test
        Test for Single and Multiple Population:
    p-value:
        Smallest level of Significance at which we can reject null hypothesis.
        p-value<alpha Reject otherwise accept
        Most stats use for each test
            







Mean: Simple average
    population miu(u) sample Xbar
    Easily affected by outlier
Median: middle number
Mode: most common prize
No best but using only one is worst.
Skewness: Measure of Asymmetry
    Data is concentrated on one side.
    Mean>Median +ve skew right
    Mean=median=mode 0skew
    mean<median -ve skew left
Variance: Dispersion od set of data around mean
    Population variance: sigma^2=(x-xmean)^2/N 
    Dispersion is distance and can't be negative so square
    Squaring amplifies the distance
    Sample variance we divide by n-1 instead=S
Standard Deviation:
    sigma=((x-xmean)^2/N )^1/2
Coefficient of Varition: SD related to mean
    SD/mean
    Comparing SD for two dataset not useful bot COV is 
Covariance: Relation b/w two variables
    sigma(x,y)=(x1-xmean)*(y1-ymean)/N
    Sample n-1
    >0 two var move together, <0 move opposite, =0 independent
Coorelation:
    Cov(x,y)/Std(x)*Std(y)
    Casuality: Important to understand directions of casual relationships.
    Disregard correlation below 0.2
