Logistic Regression:
    Non-linear models:
        quadratic
        exponential
        logistic 

Logistic Regression: Categorical instead of numerical
    Predict probability of an event occuring
    Gives result in 0 and 1
    p(x)=e^(B0+B1x1+...Bkxk)/1+e(B0+B1x1+...Bkxk)
Logit Regression Model
    p(x)/1-p(x)=e^(B0+B1x1+...Bkxk)
Build Logistic Regression:
    Method: MLE Maximum Likelihood estimation
        Func which estimates how likely model hand describes real relation of variables.
        Bigger likelihood, higher probability model is correct.
    Log-likelihood: Bigger it is good. Mostly negative.
    LL-Null: log likelihood of model with no independent variables.
    Pseudo-R squared: AIC, BIC, McFaddens R-squared(Good b/w 0.2 aND 0.4)
Binary Predictors in Logistic Regression:
Underfitting and Overfitting in Logistic Regression:
    Opposition of accuracy is misclassification rate
