Probability
    0-1 A Event P(A): Probability 
    p(A) = Preferred or Favourable/all or Sample Space
    P(A and B) = P(A).P(B) independent
    Expected Value: E(A) = p(a)*n
    Numerical Outcome = E(X) = P(A).A+P(B).B+P(C).C
Probability Frequency Distribution
Events and Complements
    A+AC=Sample Space A'
    p(A)+P(B)+P(C) = 1
    A' = B+C 
    p(A') = 1-P(A)
Combinatorics
    Permutations (Arrange set of objects/all objects)
        P(n) = n*(n-1)*....1 = n!
        p(3)=6
    Factorial
        n! = n*(n-1)!
    Variations (Arrange set of objects/not all objects)
        V(n,p) = n^p n->total no of element, p->number of position
        V(n,p) = n!/(n-p)!
        V(10,3) = 720
    Combinations (Select few objects)
        C(10,3) = 120
        C(n,p) = n!/p!(n-p)!
        C=V/P
        C(n,p) = C(n,n-p) i.e. p>n/2>n-p 
    Variety Combinations

Bayesian Inference
    Sets
        Empty Set or Null Set-> No Value 
        x belongs A or x in A or A conatins x
        For all x in A: x is even
        A is subset B 
    Properties
        Mutually Exclusive Sets: Never Touch. All complements are mutually exclusive.
            A intersect B = 0, A union B = A + B
        Intersect A union B  = A + B - A intersect B(Additive Law)
        Completely Overlap A intersect B = B, A union B = A 
        Dependent and Independent Sets:
            P(A|B) = P(A intersect B)/P(B) ->Conditional Probability 
            P(A|B) not = P(B|A)
            P(A|B)*P(B) = P(A intersect B)(Multiplicative Law)
    Baye's Law:
        P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)
